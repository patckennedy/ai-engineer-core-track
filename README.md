# 🧠 AI Engineer Core Track

Welcome to my **AI Engineer Core Track**, a hands-on learning and project space where I’m mastering **LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, and AI Agents** — the real skills behind next-generation AI systems and automation.

This repo is part of my **BigTechGirls Learning Journey**, where I document every concept, experiment, and project in a clear and professional way.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To build a strong foundation in practical AI engineering by:
- Understanding how large language models work.
- Applying them to real-world automation and business workflows.
- Creating a personal library of reusable code snippets, error fixes, and mini-projects.

Each lesson follows my **7-Step Learning Framework**:
1. Concept Explanation  
2. Why It Matters  
3. Code Example  
4. Practice Exercises  
5. Error Correction  
6. Real-World Analogy  
7. Mini-Project
